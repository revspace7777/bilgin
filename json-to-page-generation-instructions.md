Prompt for AI Agent: Python Script for Next.js Page Generation
Objective:
Create a Python script that automates the generation of multiple, unique, geo-targeted landing pages for a Next.js project. The script will use a master page.tsx template and a structured JSON data file as inputs. The goal is to create a unique page for every combination of service location (including aliases) and keyword variation defined in the JSON file.

Inputs:
Master Template File: A single Next.js page file located at ~/app/l/jacksonville-movers/page.tsx. This file contains the complete, styled, and functional React component that will serve as the template for all generated pages.

JSON Data File: A JSON file (service_area_data.json) containing the structured data provided in the Canvas document with the ID service_area_json_detailed. This file includes a list of service locations, their aliases, zip codes, and a list of keyword templates.

Core Logic & Requirements:
The Python script must perform the following steps:

Load Inputs:

Load and parse the service_area_data.json file into a Python dictionary.

Read the entire content of the ~/app/l/jacksonville-movers/page.tsx file into a single string variable. This string will be the master template.

Iteration and Generation Loop:

Create a main loop that iterates through each location object in the serviceArea.locations array from the JSON data.

For each location, create a list of all its names to iterate over: the primary name plus all entries in its aliases array.

Nest a second loop that iterates through each keywordTemplate from the JSON data.

For each unique combination of a location name/alias and a keyword template, execute the following:

Create Page Variables:

current_location_name: The specific name or alias for this iteration (e.g., "Ponte Vedra" or "Jax Beach").

primary_keyword: The main keyword for this page, generated by replacing {location} in the keyword template with current_location_name (e.g., "Ponte Vedra movers").

file_slug: A URL-friendly version of the primary_keyword (e.g., "ponte-vedra-movers").

component_name: A PascalCase name for the React component (e.g., PonteVedraMovers).

Create Output Path:

Define the output directory path as ~/app/l/{file_slug}/.

The output filename will always be page.tsx.

The script must create the directory if it does not already exist.

Instantiate Template:

Create a fresh, mutable copy of the master template string for this specific page.

Content Substitution:

Perform a series of string replacements on the template copy to replace all instances of "Jacksonville" (and its variations like "Jacksonville's") with the current_location_name.

Update the default React component export name from JacksonvilleMoversLanding to the new component_name.

LLM-Powered Semantic Variation (Placeholder):

The script should identify sections in the master template that correspond to elements in the JSON marked with an "llm_prompt".

For each of these, create a placeholder function call_llm(prompt, location).

This function should take the prompt string from the JSON and the current_location_name as arguments.

The script will then replace the static text in the template with a call to this function. For now, the function can just return the original text with the location name substituted, but the structure must be in place for a future API call.

Example: For a headline, the script should find the original text "Jacksonville's Premier Local Movers Since 1998" in the template string and replace it with {call_llm("Write a powerful headline for a local moving company in {city}, highlighting their experience and local expertise.", "{current_location_name}")}.

File Creation:

Write the fully processed template string to the designated output path (~/app/l/{file_slug}/page.tsx). The script should overwrite any existing file at that path to ensure updates can be pushed.

Example Page Generation:
Inputs: Location = "Ponte Vedra Beach", Keyword Template = "{location} moving company"

Primary Keyword: "Ponte Vedra Beach moving company"

File Slug: "ponte-vedra-beach-moving-company"

Output File: ~/app/l/ponte-vedra-beach-moving-company/page.tsx

Content: The new page.tsx will be identical in design to the Jacksonville page, but all references will be changed to "Ponte Vedra Beach", and the component will be named PonteVedraBeachMovingCompany.

Final Output:
The script, when run, should populate the ~/app/l/ directory with a series of subdirectories, each containing a fully-formed, syntactically correct page.tsx file ready for the Next.js build process.
