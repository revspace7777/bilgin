### **1\. Prompt for Cursor (Updating Existing Pages)**

This prompt instructs the agent to upgrade your previously created pages (like the Orlando one) to the new, more detailed St. Petersburg template.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: Your only task is to replace the entire content of the old page with the new template's content, and then perform specific text replacements. DO NOT change any CSS, styling, page structure, fonts, or colors in any way. The design must remain perfectly consistent with the new template.**

Objective:  
Your task is to update several existing Next.js landing pages. These pages were built using an old, simpler template (orlando-page.tsx) and need to be upgraded to a new, more detailed template (st-petersburg-page.tsx).  
**Project Context:**

* **New Master Template:** st-petersburg-page.tsx is the new golden-standard template.  
* **Old Template Example:** orlando-page.tsx is an example of the outdated structure.  
* **Goal:** Make the old pages identical in structure and content to the new template, while keeping their unique, city-specific keywords and testimonials.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. I will provide you with the file path of a page that needs to be updated (e.g., /app/jacksonville-to-orlando-movers/page.tsx).  
2. **Delete all content** in that existing file.  
3. **Copy the entire, exact content** from the new master template (st-petersburg-page.tsx) and paste it into the file you are updating.  
4. You will then perform a "find and replace" operation on the file content. **Replace every instance of the string "St. Petersburg" with "Orlando"**.  
5. Next, replace the three testimonial sections with the unique testimonials for that city, which I will provide.  
6. Finally, update any route-specific information, like travel distance, which I will also provide.

**CRITICAL REMINDER: You are not to add, remove, or modify any components, CSS classes, or styling attributes. Your only job is to replace the page content with the new template and then substitute the specified text. The design must remain perfectly consistent.**
