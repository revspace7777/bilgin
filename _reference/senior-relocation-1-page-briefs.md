# Core IT &  Infrastructure  Single-topic projects that can be done now:

1. ## Centralize Advertising costs, invoices, payments

An automation connects to each platform each day, or week, or month, runs total billing report, downloads statements & invoices, saves all to a common working folder and produces in summary dashboard 

2. ## Centralize Leads, Chats, DMs, Emails, Calls

Anything that qualifies as a lead from Website, Phone, Social, Google, Meta, etc. .. all are in a single feed like seen in the CRM demo document. 

This sets the stage for…

\- adding final transaction value to “won” leads so we can calculate Return on Ad Spend, Cost-per-lead, and find the profitable sweet spot. 

\- can tag a lead with a Lead QTuality Score which we feed back into the paid advertising. This will significantly impact the quality of the leads you get as you can then tell Google or Meta that you only want to bid on Lead Quality higher than, say, 7 out of 10

\- even without assigning a score \- simply tag lead as Customer or Not-Customer and the targeting will improve significantly 

\- see spreadsheet in this same folder \- includes all leads from [t-emoving@hotmail.com](mailto:t-emoving@hotmail.com) going back to 2012\. 

3. ## Automations for small things

**Customer submits lead on Website or Google, etc…**

1. Email and SMS auto-response include links to FAQ (Pricing, etc) and Online Booking form. With their Pricing questions answered, maybe the customer feels like just putting it on the calendar. 2 moving companies have won me this exact way. 

   2\. All new leads receive email with a 30 second video explaining pricing, how it works, frequently asked questions, and how to book, with a link to booking form. 

**Customer calls but gets Voicemail because team is busy…**

1. Automatic SMS sent to them with similar links like above 

**Customer leaves Google or online review…**  
\- AI assess the sentiment \- if it’s good review, AI responds, if it’s a bad review, AI drafts sample response and sends to your team for approval

**Customer pays invoice…**  
\- SMS asking for online review  
\- your team can control which platform they’re sent to depending on where you need reviews

## Branded Company Email Addresses

- e.g . [service@tandemovers.com](mailto:service@tandemovers.com), [hello@bandbmovers.com](mailto:hello@bandbmovers.com))

This doesn’t have to be expensive. Suppose you went with Google Workspace, for example: You could get the Business Pro plan with 2 users, which comes out to about $30/month. Each user could have multiple alias addresses under them. So [accounting@bandbmovers.com](mailto:accounting@bandbmovers.com) could still be answered by whoever handles money-emails at [bandbmovers@comcast.net](mailto:bandbmovers@comcast.net))

You’d benefit from Google’s AI being right there at your fingertips, and Business Workspace plans have AI in every app, including Gmail: Gemini, for instance, can answer questions about specific documents saved in Drive, draft a response to a customer, or set task/event reminders on the Calendar (with reminders) which you dedicated with your voice. Email, documents, spreadsheets, tasks, and calendar would be in one place.
