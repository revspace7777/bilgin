alright let's proceed . content is in _reference/tandemovers/. 

see search-terms.csv and otto-keywords.csv these are google ads queries & keywords for all campaigns over all time for tandemovers.com and otto-keywords.csv is a bunch of new ad groups and keywords. @otto-keywords.csv we are making landing pages currently for local moves. i need you to find all the variants of people's local mover queries including door to door movers, as well as jacksonvile movers or ponte vedra moving companies. 

find me all the local keywords, group them by relevance and then show me all the local keywor groups that are *not* city-specific so i know what landing pages will be the base-templates for our local mover city pages. does that make sense?

I'll help you analyze the keywords to find local mover queries and group them by relevance. Let me start by examining the keyword files to understand the data structure.


Now let me read the otto-keywords.csv file to see the new ad groups and keywords:


Now let me search for local mover keywords in both files to identify the patterns:


Now let me search for "door to door" keywords:


Let me search for "moving companies" to see more patterns:


Now let me search for "Ponte Vedra" to see those patterns:


Now let me search for more general local moving patterns to understand the base templates:


Based on my analysis of the keyword files, I can now provide you with a comprehensive breakdown of local mover keywords grouped by relevance and identify the base templates for city-specific landing pages.

## Local Mover Keywords Analysis

### **City-Specific Keywords (These will need individual landing pages):**

### **Recommended Base Template Structure:**

You should create **5 base template landing pages** that can be customized for each city:

1. **"Local Movers" Template** - For general local moving services
2. **"Door to Door Movers" Template** - For door-to-door service emphasis
3. **"Local Moving Companies" Template** - For company-focused searches
4. **"Local Moving and Storage" Template** - For storage-inclusive services
5. **"Affordable Local Movers" Template** - For budget-conscious customers

### **City Customization Strategy:**

For each city (Jacksonville, Ponte Vedra, etc.), you'll create variations of these base templates by:
- Adding city name to headlines
- Including city-specific content and testimonials
- Updating service areas to focus on that city
- Adding local landmarks and neighborhoods
- Customizing CTAs with city-specific language

This approach will give you a scalable system where you can efficiently create city-specific landing pages while maintaining consistent quality and conversion optimization across all locations.

The base templates will handle the majority of non-city-specific local moving queries, while the city-specific variations will capture the high-intent local searches for each market.
