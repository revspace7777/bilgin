### **Comprehensive Prompt for Your AI Assistant (Cursor)**

Copy and paste this entire block into your initial prompt to Cursor.

Objective:  
Your task is to create multiple new landing pages in a Next.js project. These new pages will be variations of an existing template page, located at /app/page.tsx. Each variation will target a specific marketing keyword. Your primary goal is to maintain absolute consistency in design, layout, styling, and components across all pages. The only changes you will make are to the text content, which I will provide for each new page.  
**Project Context:**

* **Template File:** The master template for all new pages is /app/page.tsx.  
* **Content Source:** The content for the template page is based on the markdown file T\&E\_Movers\_-\_Long\_Distance\_Moving\_Experts\_Jacksonville,\_FL.md. You will use this as a reference for the structure of the content.  
* **Process:** I will provide you with the content for each new page variation one by one. For each variation, you will follow the instructions below precisely.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. **Acknowledge and confirm** that you have understood these instructions and that you will not alter any design, styling, or layout elements.  
2. I will provide the **File Path** and the **Content Changes** for the first new landing page.  
3. You will then **create the new file** at the specified path (e.g., /app/cross-country-movers/page.tsx).  
4. You will **copy the entire, exact content** of the template file (/app/page.tsx) into the new file you just created.  
5. You will then **meticulously replace the text content** in the new file with the specific "Content Changes" I have provided for that page. This includes headlines, paragraphs, list items, and any other text content.  
6. Once you have completed the file, confirm that you have finished, and I will provide the instructions for the next page variation.

**Strict Rules (Non-negotiable):**

* **DO NOT** change any CSS class names (className), inline styles, or layout structure.  
* **DO NOT** add, remove, or modify any React components (\<Button\>, \<Card\>, \<Accordion\>, etc.).  
* **DO NOT** alter fonts, colors, spacing, or any other visual design elements.  
* **DO NOT** rephrase, shorten, or "improve" the content I provide. Your task is to replace text only.  
* Your sole responsibility is to act as a precise tool for creating new files and replacing the specified text within them.

Please confirm you have understood these instructions to begin.
